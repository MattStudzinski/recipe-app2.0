#What's For Dinner


I was inspired to create this application due to the amout of effort you have to put in to find the details on a recipe, searching the web it seems like theres a life story aattached to the recipe and you have to scroll for ages before you actually find the ingridients. I designed this app to remove that hasle from the process, All information is easily accessible and straight forward.

User can search through thousands of recipes using ingredients as the search parameter

User can access the link to recipe url

User can see more details such as ingredients and calorie count


# Using the app

When opening the application the user will be greeted with a homepage. this page consists of the search bar and some simple instructions on how to use the application. All the user has to do is type in ingredients or a recipe name and wait a few seconds, the search function executes automatically so no need to press enter! The results will then populate with a list of 50 recipes that each show some helpful infromation about the recipe, if the user wants to see the ingredients of the recipe just press the button "More Details" and the recipe card will expand revealing the list. Once the user is ready to take the next step they can press the "Lets Get Cooking!" button found at the bottom of the card.

# Stretch goals 

Unfortunately I wasn't able to apply a filter search to the app, where a user can click a button and the value of that button will fill into the search input.

Ability to move pages, currently there is a set amount of recipes that will come back froma search. There needs to be a load more or next page function implemented.

A filter out search, I want the user to be able to filter out ingredients they dont want included in the recipe because many people have allergies or intolerances.
